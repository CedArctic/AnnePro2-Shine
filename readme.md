# Anne Pro 2 Shine!

This is the custom LED firmware that goes along with the custom
QMK firmware for Anne Pro 2. 

This firmware is still in early development. And will probably,
but it provides the flexibility for creating custom effects.

# Build and Flash

**Warning: This will not work with the Obins Stock firmware**

To build simply type 
```bash
make
```
or
```bash
make MODEL=c18
```
if you have the C18 revision.


# Contribute

Thanks to @Stanley00 on the Anne Pro Dev discord for implementing
the key mapping for the C18 revision, and @Rusty for mapping out
the physical connection.
